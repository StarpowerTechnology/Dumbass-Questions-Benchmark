# Dumbass Benchmark

A test designed for dumb questions where the user is improperly describing the use of something & the model must be able to reason beyond the learned training data to recognize the problem.

If the problem isnt common & you describe something incorrectly, these models become limited in their reasoning. 

AI still relies on training patterns to come to a conclusion on things its never seen before.
